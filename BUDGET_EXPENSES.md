Return of value is CITYUPTAKE top priority! mrlavman SR will run its financials just like what would be expected of a company running in our cities. You can expect to see a SR financial release begining Jan 28 2019, and every 3 months there after. Transparency will be one of mrlavman SR top goals. Mrlavman SR will have 3 goals: First goal is running a fast, secure, reliable server. Second will be community outreach and awareness. Third will be return of value to CITYUPTAKE stake holders. Pending team approval these SR rewards will follow the current model for gifts; for each TRX that is rewarded .50 will be issued in CITYUPTAKE to voters. Whole numbers will be issued, so fractions will build in pending status until whole number reached. After CITYUPTAKE is rewarded .25 will be sent for every TRX rewarded to the CITYUPTAKE Trade Desk. Lastly .25 will be held to determine cost. Any changes to this model will be released during financial release. All TRX backing CITYUPTAKE will enter CITYUPTAKE diversified SR portfolio avail for withdraw if holders wishes to exchange for TRX 1:1.
