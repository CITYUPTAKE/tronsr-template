Return of value is CITYUPTAKE top priority! CITYUPTAKE will run its financials just like what would be expected of a company running in our cities. You can expect to see a SR financial release begining Jan 28 2019, and every 3 months there after. Transparency will be one of CITYUPTAKE top goals. CITYUPTAKE will have 3 goals: First goal is running a fast, secure, reliable server. Second will be community outreach and awareness. Third will be return of value to CITYUPTAKE stake holders. All SR rewards after cost will be directly transfered to the CITYUPTAKE TRADE DESK.
